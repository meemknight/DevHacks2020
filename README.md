The name of the game is Falling Cards.
It was made by Andrei Burghelea and Vlad Alexandru Luta and the basis of this game is to get a highscore by making hands of cards.
The premise of this game is that you're a poker chip with your WSOP avatar on it and you're jumping to get a good score while also being timed.
You can make hands by jumping into the cards of your respective color.
The player is encouraged to make a good hand if he wants to continue playing without worring about time.
If the player touches a card that's not his color, it will break the card into pieces, making this a good strategy for going on that royal flush.
Opening the game will present us with a wheel deciding us what the gold rush ill be for the rest of the game.
After that, cards will start falling from the sky and the proper game begins.
If you collect all the golden cards, a gold rush event will appear.
After the game ends, your score will determine how many poker chips (WSOP's in-game currency) you will receive.
